# SplineCloner

![ScreenShot](/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-28%20at%206.47.14%20PM.png)

Cloning objects along a spline in a Unity project. Based on a tutorial by [Kyle Halladay](http://kylehalladay.com/blog/tutorial/2014/03/30/Placing-Objects-On-A-Spline.html) and a [Catmull Rom Spline](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Catmull-Rom-Splines) implementation by JPBotelho.
 
Objects are placed by a desired distance apart, following a spline that is setup using objects in the scene. They are rotated smoothly to follow the drawn spline shape. 

The Editor interface allows scaling along a curve, with a min/max value to control the overall amount of scaling.
